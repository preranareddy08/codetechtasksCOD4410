**Implementation**
   The Weather App is designed to provide users with up-to-date weather information for a specified location. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface.

  **Description**

- HTML STRUCTURE
  
The HTML file (index.html) provides the structure for the Weather App interface. It consists of the following components:

html
<!-- Weather card -->
<div class="card">
  <!-- Weather information will be displayed here -->
</div>

<!-- Search bar -->
<div class="search">
  <input type="text" class="search-bar" placeholder="Enter city name" />
  <button>Search</button>
</div>
Rationale: HTML provides the basic structure for the application's user interface, defining the elements and layout required for displaying weather information and user interaction.


 -CSS STRUCTURE
 
The CSS file (styles.css) applies styles to elements in the HTML to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the Weather App. Key styling includes:
.card {
  /* Styles for weather card */
}

.search-bar {
  /* Styles for search bar */
}

button {
  /* Styles for buttons */
}

/* Additional CSS styles for layout, colors, fonts, etc. */
Rationale: CSS styles are crucial for creating an engaging and visually appealing user interface. They enhance the readability of weather information and improve the overall user experience.


-JavaScript Functionality

  The JavaScript file (script.js) provides the core functionality of the Weather App. Key features include:

let weather = {
  apiKey: "aba6ff9d6de967d5eac6fd79114693cc",
  fetchWeather: function(city) {
    fetch(
      "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" +
      city +
      "&units=metric&appid=" +
      this.apiKey
    )
    .then((response) => {
      if (!response.ok) {
        alert("No weather found.");
        throw new Error("No weather found.");
      }
      return response.json();
    })
    .then((data) => this.displayWeather(data));
  },
  displayWeather: function(data) {
    // Display weather data on the webpage
  },
  search: function() {
    this.fetchWeather(document.querySelector(".search-bar").value);
  },
};

// Event listener for search button
document.querySelector(".search button").addEventListener("click", function() {
  weather.search();
});

// Event listener for Enter key in search bar
document.querySelector(".search-bar").addEventListener("keyup", function(event) {
  if (event.key == "Enter") {
    weather.search();
  }
});

// Initial weather fetch
weather.fetchWeather("Manipal");
Implementation Details: The JavaScript file handles the fetching of weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, displaying the retrieved data, and handling user interactions such as searching for weather information.



**Implementation Details**
API Integration: The Weather App integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and the OpenCageData Geocoder API for reverse geocoding to obtain location information.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal display and functionality across various devices and screen sizes.

Error Handling: Error handling mechanisms are implemented to notify users in case of failed API requests or invalid input.

Rationale: These implementation details ensure that the Weather App delivers accurate and reliable weather information while maintaining a seamless user experience.

**Conclusion**
This concludes the documentation for the Weather App, providing insights into its implementation details and rationale. For further details, refer to the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
